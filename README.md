## Bone morphogenetic protein 4 induces hematopoietic stem cell development from murine hemogenic endothelial cells in culture
Here, we provide the code we used to classify and analyze cell populations, including endothelial cells (EC), in the Psp using single-cell RNA-seq analysis of the P-sp region at mouse embryonic day 9.5 under the R environment.
The method for collecting embryonic cells used in scRNA-seq analysis is described below (Tsuruda et al., submitted).
The analysis method used in this project was based on [this site](https://satijalab.org/seurat/).

## Data
The scRNA-seq data are available in [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession numbers GSE271523.
