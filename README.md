## Bone morphogenetic protein 4 induces hematopoietic stem cell development from murine hemogenic endothelial cells in culture

## What this project does/Why this project is useful
BMP4 has been newly identified as an essential factor inducing HSC development from immature HECs. BMP4 receptors serve as valuable markers for isolating immature HECs that can function as HSCs and analyzing the early stages of HSC development (Tsuruda et al., submitted). In this project, we will perform single-cell RNA-seq analysis of the Psp region of mouse embryos at embryonic day 9.5 to classify cell populations contained in the Psp region. We will also provide codes for comparative genetic analysis of the presence or absence of BMP receptor expression in endothelial cell populations and for searching for signaling ligands acting on receptor-positive HECs.

## Data
The scRNA-seq data are available in GEO under accession numbers GSE271523.
