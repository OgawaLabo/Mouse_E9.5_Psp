## Bone morphogenetic protein 4 induces hematopoietic stem cell development from murine hemogenic endothelial cells in culture
Here, we provide the code we used to analyze csingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data using para-aortic splanchnopleure (P-Sp) at embryonic day 9.5 under the R environment (Tsuruda et al., submitted).
This code was provided by [this website](https://satijalab.org/seurat/).
