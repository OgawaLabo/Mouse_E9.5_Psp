## Bone morphogenetic protein 4 induces hematopoietic stem cell development from murine hemogenic endothelial cells in culture
This project provides code used to classify and analyze endothelial cell (EC) populations in the P-sp region in mouse embryos at embryonic day 9.5 using single-cell RNA-seq analysis. The method for collecting embryonic cells used in scRNA-seq analysis is described below (Tsuruda et al., submitted).
The analysis method used in this project was based on [this site](https://satijalab.org/seurat/).

## Data
The scRNA-seq data are available in [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession numbers GSE271523.
